f,F,"This represents the steady-state fluorescence, which is the fluorescence emitted by chlorophyll when the plant is exposed to light, indicating the efficiency of light energy capture.",,,
f0,F0,"The minimum fluorescence level observed in dark-adapted conditions, representing the baseline fluorescence when all reaction centers are open and no electron transport is happening.",,,
fm,Fm,"The maximum fluorescence emitted under saturating light conditions, where all reaction centers are closed, and photosystem II is fully excited.",,,
fm',Fm_prime,"The maximum fluorescence emitted under light-adapted conditions, providing information about the maximum capacity of photosystem II under normal light conditions.",,,
epar,Epar,"The photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), which refers to the light that plants use for photosynthesis. It is typically measured in micromoles of photons per square meter per second (?mol m?² s?¹).",,,
y.ii.,Y.II.,"The quantum yield of photosystem II, representing the efficiency with which absorbed light is used for photochemistry, often referred to as the proportion of absorbed light that is used in photochemistry.",,,
etr,ETR,"The electron transport rate, which quantifies the rate of electron flow through the photosynthetic electron transport chain, influencing the plant's ability to fix carbon.",,,
fv/fm,Fv/Fm,"The maximum quantum efficiency of photosystem II, which is calculated as (fm - f0) / fm. This ratio is used to assess the efficiency of photosystem II in utilizing light energy.",,,
npq,NPQ,"Non-photochemical quenching, representing the process by which excess light energy is dissipated as heat in order to protect the plant from photodamage.",,,
deltanpq,deltaNPQ,"The change in non-photochemical quenching, often used to indicate the plant's adjustment to light conditions and the dynamic regulation of energy dissipation.",,,
retr,rETR,"The relative electron transport rate, which can be used to assess the efficiency of the electron transport process and its impact on overall photosynthesis efficiency.",,,
